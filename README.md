# specialty-slurper

Tool to extract winners from AKC show results (for Basenji Specialties in particular)

This has been massively refactored, an automated pipeline should be added.

### TODO

- [ ] add "specialty-slurper cache ..." commands to manage the cache?
- [ ] add "specialty-slurper config ..." commands to manage the config?
